                <h3>Kaosi Nwosu</h3>
                <p>As a Computer Science major set to graduate in 2025, my passion for problem-solving is the cornerstone of my academic journey. Python isn't just a language for me; it's a canvas where I paint my projects and lab works with meticulous care. My proficiency doesn't end there—I'm equally skilled in Java and JavaScript, languages that I look forward to using to develop a personal website. This site will not only showcase my journey but will evolve into an interactive portal that answers queries about me, akin to an AI chatbot, after taking the AI course UMass has to offer. Formula 1 is not just a hobby; it's a thrill that races through my veins, and I'm intrigued by the potential of using Python to dissect the stock market. My goal is to construct a predictive model that adeptly navigates trades, much like a skilled driver on the race track. I am a part of the National Society of Black Engineers where I function as an academic chair and help drive the professional and academic development of the members.</p>

             <p>FitMatch, as an app, aims to be a pillar for community engagement and a launchpad for self-improvement through various forms of exercise. At its core, Fitmatch's functionality will be supported through a simple yet solid database that will store basic user data: identification, fitness goals, fitness preferences, and their progress in their respective areas of concentration.

This feature should enable users to input detailed information, including the exercises performed, sets, reps, and weights lifted during each workout session. Additionally, the system should support the storage and retrieval of this data in a structured format to ensure accuracy and accessibility. Furthermore, FitMatch should incorporate progress tracking graphs and analytics tools that provide users with visual representations of their fitness journey, allowing them to monitor their progress over time and identify areas for improvement. These features are essential for empowering users to track their workouts effectively, gain valuable insights into their performance, and stay motivated on their fitness goals.</p>
