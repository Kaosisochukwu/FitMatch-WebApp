                <h3>Kaosi Nwosu</h3>
                <p>As a Computer Science major set to graduate in 2025, my passion for problem-solving is the cornerstone of my academic journey. Python isn't just a language for me; it's a canvas where I paint my projects and lab works with meticulous care. My proficiency doesn't end there—I'm equally skilled in Java and JavaScript, languages that I look forward to using to develop a personal website. This site will not only showcase my journey but will evolve into an interactive portal that answers queries about me, akin to an AI chatbot, after taking the AI course UMass has to offer. Formula 1 is not just a hobby; it's a thrill that races through my veins, and I'm intrigued by the potential of using Python to dissect the stock market. My goal is to construct a predictive model that adeptly navigates trades, much like a skilled driver on the race track. I am a part of the National Society of Black Engineers where I function as an academic chair and help drive the professional and academic development of the members.</p>

                <p>I'm Ahmed Saeed, a dedicated BSc Computer Science student with a Business minor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. My passion lies in web development, and I've gained valuable experience during my internship at Folio3, where I contributed to building responsive web applications using React.js, resulting in a notable increase in client website traffic. I've also honed my skills in QA testing, documentation, and agile methodologies while interning at Regional Economic Models, Inc. My technical expertise spans various programming languages and frameworks like Python, JavaScript, React, and Node.js. Additionally, I've garnered experience in IT support and cybersecurity at University Health Services. As a leader, I've served as Treasurer of the UMass Pakistani Student Organization and as an Orientation Leader for New Student Orientation & Transitions, fostering cultural awareness and community engagement. With a strong foundation in computer science principles and a drive for excellence, I'm ready to make impactful contributions to web development.</p>
